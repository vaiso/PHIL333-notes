## Module 6: Two-Tier Healthcare

---

### Overview

This short one lesson module focuses on the appropriate way to provide access to healthcare in Canada - should it continue as a government run system, or should it be supplemented by (or even replaced by) a privately run, market-based system? Libertarian opposition to publicly funded healthcare and defense of a right to purchase private healthcare are examined and evaluated. Egalitarian arguments in favour of publicly funded healthcare and against private healthcare are considered and critiqued. Arguments for a two-tier system are then debated. Finally, we consider if it is morally permissible for people to use private healthcare if the system is not just.

### Learning Objectives

* Explain and evaluate the libertarian argument for a right to private health care
* Explain and evaluate the libertarian argument against publicly funded health care
* Explain and evaluate the egalitarian arguments against two-tiered health care
* Explain Warren’s and Patrick’s arguments for the conditions under which two-tiered health care is just, and whether those conditions are currently satisfied in Canada
* Explain Warren, Patrick and Doran's views on the permissibility of using private health care, when the system is administered in a way that is unjust
* Develop your own views and arguments on when, if ever, two-tier healthcare is justified.
* Explain your argument on whether it is morally permissible to use the private system in Canada if the two-tier system is not administered in a way that is just
