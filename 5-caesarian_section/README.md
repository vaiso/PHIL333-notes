## Module 5: Caesarian Section

---

### Overview

In this brief, one lesson, Module, we consider some of the ethical issues surrounding Caesarean-section, when it is chosen by the pregnant woman, for non-medical reasons (CSBC). This topic leads us to explore the difficult question of the circumstances under which one may place oneself and others under greater than normal risks. Throughout the discussion, the value of individual autonomy is placed against the moral importance of not taking needless risks with others' well-being. Thought experiments and analogies are frequently discussed in an attempt to clarify the issue.

### Learning Objectives

* State your view on whether you think CSBC is morally permissible, and why;
* Anticipate the principal objections to your argument, and explain why those objections fail;
* Consider the strongest arguments for the opposing view on the moral permissibility of CSBC and explain why those arguments fail;
* State your view on whether CSBC ought to be available, and, if so, under what conditions. Consider opposing points of view, and why you disagree.
